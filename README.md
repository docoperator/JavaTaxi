# JavaTaxi
Taxi app, build as much as you can in 30 minutes


I like to use this app as a modified more complex hello world.  The depth at which I create the application is the depth at which I am comfortable within the language.

I'm new to Java, at least as something I do on a daily basis, so I like to see how I compare against something like .NET

Create an Application which calculates a Taxi Rider's Fare when given the number of blocks driven.

*.25 cents per block
*minimum ride fee 2.25
*required tip 4%

** Correction is:
.25 * 1/8 of a mile.
each block is 1/4 mile long.
